# Shadowbot
Shadowbot is a Linux term dictionary for Discord. 
The purpose of Shadowbot is to allow non Linux users understand what is going on in a discussion.

This bot requires Python 3.5.3+ and Discord.py to be installed

It is recommended to run on a Linux based system for accuracy but it can run on Windows, Mac, BSD, etc. just fine.

The bot's sole command which isn't yet implemented is `shadowbot define [TERMS] which will make the bot define the terms you put in.

This bot is still a work in progress so maybe check back later and we'll have it working.
