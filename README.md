# Shadowbot

Shadowbot is a Linux term dictionary and currency tracker for Discord. 
The purpose of Shadowbot is to allow non Linux users understand what is going on in a discussion and to allow discord users to gain a currency they can spend stuff on.

This bot requires Python 3.5.3+ and Discord.py installed

It is recommended to run on a Linux based system for accuracy but it can run on Windows, Mac, BSD, etc. just fine.


> This bot is still a work in progress so maybe check back later and we'll have it working a bit better and it performing calculations better.
